    <small>This demo aims to show how to use angularjs ui-router in combination
  with a ui requirement wherein some pages need a sidebar navigation
  and others don't. You'll note that this page has
  no side navbar and uses nested content, whereas the Products 
  page includes a collapsible sidebar navigation with nested 
  content areas for each sub-nav items.</small>

  <a ui-sref=".list" class="btn btn-primary">Show Nested List</a>
  <a ui-sref=".paragraph" class="btn btn-primary">Show Nested Paragraph</a>
  <hr>
  <div ui-view>
    Click a button above to access nested content. This paragraph is default content in the nested area, which is replaced by the selected child contact when a button is clicked.
